## General Info

Website created for the "Python" course at Coderhouse.

This site was born with the idea of creating an Ecommerce store for products. Previously, it was initially developed in JavaScript, then React, Node, and now a version with Django.

**Branches:** It has two working branches: `main` (where the final project is hosted) and the `V.01` branch where updates and fixes are worked on.
